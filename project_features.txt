(Core Gameplay & Mechanics)

Player Control: WASD keys to move the UFO. Also, the left arrow and the right arrow keys make the UFO go left and right, the same as the A & D keys.

Object Management: Implement a Python class for diamonds, bombs, and bullets to manage their position, velocity, and state.

Collision Detection: Write Python functions to check for collisions between objects. Use simple bounding spheres or AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for efficiency.

Object Spawning: Implement a Python script to dynamically generate new diamond and bomb instances at random intervals, ensuring they are placed outside the camera's initial view.

Scoring System: Maintain a simple integer variable in Python for the score, incrementing or decrementing it based on collision events.

Levels: There will be levels where the difficulty levels increase with the increase of velocity of the falling objects.

Penalty System: For shooting bombs, apply a penalty by deducting points and potentially applying a temporary slow-down effect by manipulating the UFO's speed variable.

Health/Life System: Track player health with a variable that decreases upon colliding with a bomb, ending the game when it reaches zero.

Difficulty Curve: Gradually increase the velocity of all incoming objects over time by updating their speed variables in the main game loop.
